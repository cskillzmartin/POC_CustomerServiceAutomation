# Customer Service Automation – RealWork Test

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept Jupyter Notebook** for automating customer service interactions using AI. The notebook demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) can be applied to classify, process, and respond to customer emails in a structured and efficient way.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world automation system where incoming customer emails are:

1. **Categorized** into predefined types (e.g., billing, technical support, account management, etc.).
2. **Processed** to extract key information such as customer ID, request type, and sentiment.
3. **Responded to automatically** using templated or AI-generated replies.
4. **Logged** into structured data for tracking and analysis.

This work forms part of a **RealWork assessment** designed to test practical AI-driven automation skills.
