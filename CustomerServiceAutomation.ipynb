The system should accurately categorize emails as either product inquiries or order requests and generate appropriate responses using the product catalog information and current stock status.\n","\n","## Task Description\n","\n","### Inputs\n","\n","Google Spreadsheet **[Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14fKHsblfqZfWj3iAaM2oA51TlYfQlFT4WKo52fVaQ9U)** containing:\n","\n","- **Products**: List of products with fields including product ID, name, category, stock amount, detailed description, and season.\n","\n","- **Emails**: Sequential list of emails with fields such as email ID, subject, and body.\n","\n","### Requirements\n","\n","#### 1. Classify emails\n","    \n","Classify each email as either a _**\"product inquiry\"**_ or an _**\"order request\"**_. Ensure that the classification accurately reflects the intent of the email.\n","\n","**Output**: Populate the **email-classification** sheet with columns: email ID, category.\n","\n","#### 2. Process order requests\n","1.   Process orders\n","  - For each order request, verify product availability in stock.\n","  - If the order can be fulfilled, create a new order line with the status \"created\".\n","  - If the order cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient stock, create a line with the status \"out of stock\" and include the requested quantity.\n","  - Update stock levels after processing each order.\n","  - Record each product request from the email.\n","  - **Output**: Populate the **order-status** sheet with columns: email ID, product ID, quantity, status (**_\"created\"_**, **_\"out of stock\"_**).\n","\n","2.   Generate responses\n","  - Create response emails based on the order processing results:\n","      - If the order is fully processed, inform the customer and provide product details.\n","      - If the order cannot be fulfilled or is only partially fulfilled, explain the situation, specify the out-of-stock items, and suggest alternatives or options (e.g., waiting for restock).\n","  - Ensure the email tone is professional and production-ready.\n","  - **Output**: Populate the **order-response** sheet with columns: email ID, response.\n","\n","#### 3. Handle product inquiry\n","\n","Customers may ask general open questions.\n","  - Respond to product inquiries using relevant information from the product catalog.\n","  - Ensure your solution scales to handle a full catalog of over 100,000 products without exceeding token limits. Avoid including the entire catalog in the prompt.\n","  - **Output**: Populate the **inquiry-response** sheet with columns: email ID, response.\n","\n","## Implementation Overview\n","\n","This solution uses advanced AI techniques including:\n","- **GPT-4o** for email classification and response generation\n","- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for product inquiries\n","- **FAISS vector store** for efficient product search\n","- **Sentence Transformers** for text embeddings\n","\n","The system processes emails in the following order:\n","1. Email Classification (LLM-based)\n","2. Order Processing (Stock checking, inventory updates)\n","3. Response Generation (Professional email responses)\n","4.
